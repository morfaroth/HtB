An initial nmap scan revealed a website running on port 80

Reviewing this website hinted at a subdomain, found members subdomain by trial and error.

Used gobuster on subdomain to find login page.

Explored login requests in burp suite. Found that the logintype parameter is injectable, and if remember me is on, information can be leaked in base64

Wrote exploit to gain a limited shell using SQL injection.

Discovered all commands are capitalized, and applocker is prevening .exe from running.

Uploaded executables using certutil, giving them alternate extensions, and ran these to get a full shell.

Migrated to 64bit process, and used capcom exploit to elevate privleges

Reversed root.exe (Revisit this with better description later)
